# Spelling Bee

A replica of NYT's [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

## Features
- Connects to NYT data source (I've chosen to use yesterday's data - can't imagine NYT would be happy with today's game out there for free)
- Saves answers in localStorage so you can enjoy the game throughout the day

## Stack
- Next JS
- Tailwind
- Jest
